Alright back at it on 12/16/2020. I had a thought while I was away (side note: sometimes it helps to step away for a few hours or the rest of the day and come back to a problem. You'll always think of something good, trust me on this.). By the way I'm also going to go back and document all of these vulnerabilities a little more carefully and start giving them identifiers (e.g. HGV-0, HGV-1). Why? Because it's cool af and I also am not a fan of the current CVE system, which (I think) requires "responsible disclosure" (rant about that to come) which I do not believe in. Anyway, let's get back to hacking.

The thought that I had was that I'm getting a bunch of less interesting null ptr derefs whenever I give explorer.exe a "bad character" (chars disallowed by typical path names). Make no mistake, these are still vulnerabilities, there are plenty of examples out there of exploiting null page derefs, they are just far more rare than things like overflows and memory disclosure bugs. Anyway, my thinking is this: I'm looking for a vuln that fits a particular model, in particular one that allows me to take remote control of a machine without the user having to even click on the file. This seems do-able since even the functions that just list contents of a folder appear to be vulnerable to pretty much anything except for standard ascii characters (bit of an exaggeration but you get it). So instead of gathering a ton of crashes that will be with illegal characters, let's strip out the illegal chars one by one and see what happens, until we find a vuln that is not based on illegal characters. I'm going to try this, but also keep in the back of my mind that there is *possibly* an avenue to create files with illegal characters in them, the standard API doesn't seem to allow it (it causes a null deref), but perhaps editing some metadata somewhere in the system will allow me to do this, again let's put a pin in that and come back to it. For now let's strip 0x0A and 0x0D (line break, carriage return) which I know are illegal chars in a filename.

Interestingly enough as I was building this I found a different kind of crash while testing the fuzzer, this is with identical code to the one as before:

A UAF! OK, but now I'm confused... that crash file seems to have no data in it, which is both disallowed by my code, and shouldn't be a thing... so what's up? Well, I need to be more careful. My C++ is not amazing, I can get by, I can look stuff up, I know the logic and patterns of C++ in Windows, but I'm by no means an expert. So even though this "UAF" appears like an amazing win it's not. I recompiled my code with a simple main() function instead of the LLVMFuzzer* function and ran it - it crashed. There was an access violation on the Null page. So clearly this was a me error. After spending some time and ensuring I wasn't causing memory errors from my own code, but instead from the Windows API, I came to the following, along with a simple idea to improve my fuzz power:

```
#include <shlobj.h>
#include <shlobj_core.h>
#include <shlwapi.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <objbase.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int fuzzMeDrZaus(LPCWSTR path, const uint8_t *Data, size_t size)
{
    //LPITEMIDLIST *itemlist;
    ITEMIDLIST *itemlist;
    SHParseDisplayName(path, NULL, &itemlist, NULL, NULL);
    SHGetFolderLocation(0, NULL, 0, 0, &itemlist);
    return 0;
};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) 
{
  LPCWSTR _str = L"C:\\DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\\";
  fuzzMeDrZaus(_str, Data, Size);
  return 0;
};
```

Basically all this does is generate an LPCITEMIDLIST to give to SHGetFolderLocation from a human readable string, in this case C:\DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\. I do run the risk of crashing SHParseDisplayName, but perhaps if I let it run long enough I can get a crash in SHGetFolderLocation. We'll see, so far the problem has been too many, as opposed to not enough, crashes. And boom goes the dynamite:

Pretty good exec speed so far, let's keep it going. Now I'm kinda curious to run this under WinAFL. It seems all I'd need to do is grab....fuck wait. OK look at my code again, shame on you for not noticing. Do you see anything? Well, as it turns out I forgot to do anything with Data (the variable libFuzzer constantly mutates), so all I was doing was parsing C:\DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\ a fuckton of times. That's useless. However I want to somewhat preserve what I'm doing, have a C:\ to start out, and some normal letters after. So I came up with this code:

```
#include <shlobj.h>
#include <shlobj_core.h>
#include <shlwapi.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <objbase.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int fuzzMeDrZaus(LPCWSTR path, const uint8_t *Data, size_t size)
{
    //LPITEMIDLIST *itemlist;
    ITEMIDLIST *itemlist;
    int dataSize = sizeof(Data);
    memcpy(path+0x7, Data, size);
    SHParseDisplayName(path, NULL, &itemlist, NULL, NULL);
    SHGetFolderLocation(0, NULL, 0, 0, &itemlist);
    return 0;
};

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) 
{
  LPCWSTR _str = L"C:\\DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\\";
  fuzzMeDrZaus(_str, Data, Size);
  return 0;
};
```

What's that do? Notice the memcpy, that's saying write to an address at 7 bytes into the string using the data provided via the Data variable. The write will be of a size size, which is the variable that holds the size of libFuzzer's data. Let's try that now. I'm out for the night though, picking back up in next post.
