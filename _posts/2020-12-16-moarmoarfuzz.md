Alright back at it on 12/16/2020. I had a thought while I was away (side note: sometimes it helps to step away for a few hours or the rest of the day and come back to a problem. You'll always think of something good, trust me on this.). By the way I'm also going to go back and document all of these vulnerabilities a little more carefully and start giving them identifiers (e.g. HGV-0, HGV-1). Why? Because it's cool af and I also am not a fan of the current CVE system, which (I think) requires "responsible disclosure" (rant about that to come) which I do not believe in.
